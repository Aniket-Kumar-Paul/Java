1. by default, if we declare a variable/array but don't initialize,
    it gets initialized by 0 or null instead of garbage values
2. Convention - all classes start with Upper case
              - all constants are written in UPPER CASE
3. OOPS
    - Abstraction
    - Encapsulation 
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism 
        - Compile time : Function overloading
        - Runtime : Inheritance
                        - Single level (Base class -> Derived class)
                        - Multi level (Base Class -> Derived class 1 -> Derived class of Derived class 1)
                        - Hierarchical (Base Class -> Multiple Derived Class)
                        - Hybrid
                        - Multiple (using Interfaces in Java) (multiple Base classes -> one Derived class)
4. No need to explicitly write destructors in java as java has garbage collector
5. 4 access modifiers
        - public -> anyone can access
        - private -> can be accessed only inside the particular class
        - protected -> anyone can access in its own package, but in other packages only subclasses can access
        - default (default) -> apne package k andar saari chize access kar payengi but not other packages
6. Abstraction - can have abstract and non abstract methods
               - cannot be instantiated
               - can have constructors and static methods also
               - can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method
7. Interfaces - all fields in interfaces are public, static and final by default
              - all methods are public and abstract by default
              - can't have constructors and non abstract methods
              - the Derived class must implement all methods declared in the interface
              - supports functionality of multiple Inheritance
